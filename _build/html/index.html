<p>This website was created by Gavin Schaeferle and Austin &#8220;last name&#8221;. The purpose of this website is to analysis data about the Football World Cup. To do this, we set about answering one big question: <strong>How has the world cup changed over time?</strong> To answer this question, we focused on multiple aspects of our data, these subsections are</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>&#8220;Does being the host country increase your chances of winning?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Does being the home team in a match increase your chances of winning?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Which country has won the most World Cups? And Which team won the most matches within the World Cup?</li>
<li>&#8220;Which World Cup has had the most scoring?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Which World Cup had the most autendous?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Which World Cup had the most penenties?&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, we found that the world cup has been increasing in popularity and increasing in the number of teams participating. However, the most interesting thing to notice, is how the world cup not only grow on it&#8217;s own, but also grew along side the world as a whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-accusition-and-manipulation">
<h1>Data Accusition and Manipulation<a class="headerlink" href="#data-accusition-and-manipulation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The first step to any data science project, is to aquire some data. In our project, this was done be vigorously scrolling through the internet, trying to find any data on the World Cup. Our first stop was kaggle.com, because it has some really good data on a lot of different subjects, expetinoally sports. And after looking around for a while, we did in fact find the data we were looking for <a class="reference external" href="...">here</a>. On that website&#8217;s page, we found three datasets. The first had information on the gernal world cups from 1930 to 2014. The second had information on each match that happened at each world cup. The last on had information each people and couch of each team in each world cup. From this data, we had to do a little data monuvering to get them all together and working. This was done by doing a quick join in pandas like this:</p>
<p>the dataframe <em>matches</em> is the dataframe with every match in each world cup. next, the set_index([&#8216;Year&#8217;]) is used to make sure the two dataframes have the same index. Next, within the join function, the <em>cups</em> dataframe contains the gernal information on each world cup. Notice the .drop function being called on the <em>cups</em> dataframe. This was done because both <em>matches</em> and <em>cups</em> have a column called &#8220;Attendance&#8221; so to make the join work, one of them had to go. We choose to drop the <em>cups</em> column because there are more match attendaces then cups so later on the <em>matches</em> attendance column will be used along with the other info in <em>matches</em> and <em>cups</em> so having that column is more important. Finally, we set the index of the <em>cups</em> dataframe to be the same as the <em>matches</em> dataframe and we got ourselves a good joined dataframe. This is just the beginning of all the data munipulations that are done to this dataframe to create the graphs later on in this website.</p>
<p>The other big change to the data was adding a column for which team won each match. This may not at first seem like such a challenge, because there are columns of which how many times a team scored in the match. However, the score doesn&#8217;t take into account if the match was a tie at the end of regulation time. So one of the harder things to add within the data was a column that could tell into another column &#8220;win condition&#8221; and if that row&#8217;s cell had that countries name in it, then say true. Otherwise (if they did lose) then say False. More information on how this was done in the notebook</p>

<div class="section" id="host-country-data">
<h1>Host Country Data<a class="headerlink" href="#host-country-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>To start answer the big question <strong>How has the world cup changed over time?</strong> we started by looking at how the host country did over time, and how has being the &#8220;home&#8221; country changed over time. <a class="reference external" href="notebooks/Worldcupdata.ipynb">Here</a> is the analysis of that data</p>
<p>From this analysis we created two graphs. The first one shows the number of times a host country made it into the final four.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/hosttopfour.png" src="_images/hosttopfour.png" />
</div>
<p>From just this graph, it doesn&#8217;t seem like there is much evidence to conclude that meaning the host country means you will be in the semi-finals. While the true bar is slightly higher, it&#8217;s not enough to conclude any difference. What this graph is used for a start into some more interesting graphs comparing all matches to host country, which starts to get more interesting.</p>
<p>The second one, we created three graphs that show three different things. The first shows the total host country wins over each world cup. The second shows the percent of wins by the host country each world cup. And finally the last one is a bit hard to put into words. Mainly, each block&#8217;s height is the the number of times a percent of wins by the host country was between 0.2-0.29; 0.3-0.39; ...</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/hostratio.png" src="_images/hostratio.png" />
</div>
<p>from these three graphs, it&#8217;s clear that there isn&#8217;t much of an increase of whither or not they will win a match if they are the host country, over time and in general. We can see this from the fact that there is no clear linear pattern or any pattern with either of the two scatter graphs. However, while the mean percent of wins for a host country is over 50%, meaning the host team has a greater then 50% chance of winning. I would agrue that this increase isn&#8217;t enough for there to be any significant evidence that being the host country makes you more likely to win a match. More then likely, the match would have been won regardless of there host status. One thing to note, however, is the slight inversion of the total vs year compared to ratio vs year. This will be shown off in more detail in the next graphs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="home-team-data">
<h1>Home Team Data<a class="headerlink" href="#home-team-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Going along with the host country data, the home team data looks at how often the home team won over the year. With this data, we created one figure with three graphs</p>
<p>The three graphs are very similar to the host country&#8217;s three graph figure. The first one looks at how many times the home team won their match over each world cup. The second looks at the precent of times the home country won. And the final graph creates a histogram of percents of wins.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/homeratio.png" src="_images/homeratio.png" />
</div>
<p>From the three graphs, it&#8217;s clear that there was at one point a very signficant home field advantage. It seems that before 1970, if you were the home team, you were almost certain to win. And with a standerd deveation of 0.088, 50% is clearly not close to the mean. However, after 1970, the mean ratio of wins is closer to 50% being within one standerd deviation. So this means that at one point, there was a significant chance of winning if you were the home team. But now a days, it is more random. Also from the first graph, you can see a postive linear slope that shows that as time went on, more matches were played. Yet contrasting to what was said before, as time went on, the percent of times the home team won has gone down over time. So, what we can gather from this data, is that the world cup has both gotten more random in it&#8217;s selection of who is the home team, and, more importantly, that as time went on, more teams were more evenly matched.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="country-wins">
<h1>Country Wins<a class="headerlink" href="#country-wins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a more broader view of the world cup and look at each countires win rate. The first graph looks at the number of times a country has won a world cup</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/matcheswinovertime.png" src="_images/matcheswinovertime.png" />
</div>
<p>Notice how few countries there are! out of 20 different world cups, only eight countries have every won the whole thing. Really shows how dominating some countries are at football!</p>
